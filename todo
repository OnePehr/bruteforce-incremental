Gameplan:  
    - store up in incremental pace with upgrades and such to reach (diff upgrades below)
        Diiferent upgrades:
            - Knowledge of the Lock Type
                Understanding whether the phone is locked by a PIN, pattern, password, fingerprint, or face recognition.
            - Brute Force Software
                Specialized software that can automate the process of entering different combinations. Examples include Hydra, John the Ripper, or custom scripts.
            - Hardware
                In some cases, specialized hardware might be needed to interface with the phone, especially if the software needs to communicate directly with the phone's hardware (e.g., via JTAG or UART interfaces).
            - Access to the Phone
                Physical possession of the phone is typically required.
            - Knowledge of the Phone's System
                Understanding of the phoneâ€™s operating system (e.g., Android, iOS) and any specific vulnerabilities or exploits that can be leveraged.
            - bypass Mechanisms
                Knowledge of any potential bypass techniques for lock screens, such as security vulnerabilities, exploits, or recovery mode features.
            - Patience and Computational Power
                Depending on the complexity of the lock (length and type of password/PIN), significant computational power and time might be required.
            - Legal and Ethical Considerations
    
    - With enough is stored up you earn prestige points (Nr of bruteforced phones)
        Prestige points:
            - With prestige point you buy so you can bruteforce more phones
            From start you bruteforce like Phone-A then you can unlock
            Phone B with give Xmore speed
